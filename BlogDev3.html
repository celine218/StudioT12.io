              <h3> Shocking Jada tutorial! </h3>
              <p>After a well-deserved Thanksgiving break, we are right back to it. This past week has been busy at Studio T12, here’s a few highlights of what we’ve done.</p>

<p>After last weeks’ playtesting, several parts of the game have been improved or fixed. These fixes are all about feedback and clarity, making the game less confusing and feel better to play. In other words, the exact kind of fixes you’d expect after all that playtesting. Some short examples are:</p>
 <p>- The testing room minigame was confusing for many. Making it faster and removing the mouse during the “show” part mitigated much of that.</p>
 <p>- Some players had trouble figuring out what to interact with and so some markers have been making it more clear what players can interact with.</p>
 <p>- Each part of the demo has now also received a short tutorial to help players learn how to play the game.</p>
<p>Finally, the UI has received an overhaul based on feedback, specifically the social map (where players can see how the characters are related to each other). The previous version did not make much sense so it has been entirely redone. The new one also has better feedback now (sound! Who would have thought). See before and after pictures below.</p>

<p>Playtesting is continuing (and is in fact happening today!) and we are getting more great feedback. If you are interested, you can play the demo here!</p>

<p>Finally, another post has appeared on our social feeds, please check it out!</p>

<p>That’s it for now! See you next week!</p>
