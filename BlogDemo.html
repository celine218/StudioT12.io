              <h3> Chapter 1 Demo </h3>
              <p>After 5 long months, we are so incredibly proud to introduce our debut demo for "Silent Numbers"! Our incredible team delivered all on our goals, including incredible 2D pixel art, compelling environments, funky tunes, and a compelling story. We are so excited to share with all of you! </p>

              <p> Within these 5 months we've been able to conceptualize, build prototypes, and complete a playable build. But this is only the beginning of this adventure!This game draws inspiration from ARG elements and needs a community to piece together what's happening in the depths of the labs. </p>

 <p>The demo for chapter 1 is out NOW on itch.io.</p>
 <p> Our development logs will be posted here, as well as on our social handles! </p>

<p>Thank you all for your incredible support, and we hope to see you in future devlogs! See ya! </p>
