A young woman named Jada is held captive hundreds of feet underground as torturous tests are performed on her. Upon her arrival, the initial surgery on her leaves her bewildered with memories and information about the facility that don't seem to belong to her. Something calls for her to enact. <br> Unlock repressed memories, foreign recollections, and old diary entries to collect context for the present tense. <br> Three conciousnesses, one story. </p>
