              <h3> Steam announcement! </h3>
              <p>Sneaking in just before the holidays, here’s another devlog from the team!</p>

              <p>Big news, we got a <b>STEAM STORE PAGE!</b></p>
              <img class="MainBlogImageLeft" src="images/SteamLogoGreen.png">
<p>Check it out and please go wishlist the game </p>
<a class = "button" href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/4234110/Silent_Numbers/"> WISHLIST HERE </a>
<p>For this, a new teaser was also released to our socials with this announcement</p>
<a class = "button" href = "https://youtube.com/shorts/mukmi1Sfa0M"> WATCH HERE </a>
<p>This is all in preparation for our next big milestone, an upcoming Steam demo, which a lot of work this week has gone into preparing for. We will have more to share about that later, but below is a little teaser with some updated character art, including a new secret character. Who is it? Who knows! They sure look very chill for being in an ominous underground facility.</p>

<p>In other accomplishments, a BUNCH of writing has been completed for the demo, new 2D art is still rolling in, and 2 new music tracks have been made (and more are on the way!). Finally, the concepts for the upcoming environments are done and we are ready to begin implementing them in the game.</p>

<p>Finally, we are also ready to launch our community Discord server where you and other fans can chat about Silent Numbers together!</p>
<a class = "button" href = "https://discord.gg/hxQEZgnNF9"> JOIN HERE </a>
<p>It is still early days but we hope you want to come hang out!</p>

<p>And that’s it! This will be our final devlog for the year, see you in… 2026! Hope you have a happy holiday and only a few spooks. But you know, good spooks.</p>
