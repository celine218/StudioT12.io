              <h3> Build updates and growing team</h3>
<p>First off, we have a community manager now! These words are in fact written by him. Wow! You’ll see more words and posts (as well as an upcoming Discord server, tease, hint) in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>On that note, we are now also on Bluesky! Please give a follow if you’re there!</p>

<p> We also launched our trailer for the demo! You can check it out on our socials!</p>

<p> Meanwhile, the team has been hard at work playtesting and improving the demo and the rest of the game. 
As a special highlight, the team has been concepting 2 new stunning 3D environments and are in the process of blocking them out in Blender. Very excited to see these in the game! </p>

<p>The team also took the demo into new spaces and got playtesting at Independent Games Collaboration @ UCSC and the Santa Cruz Game Dev Meetup hosted by Tyler Coleman. We got a ton of great feedback and have been busy at work improving a new build!  </p>

<p> Favorite quote from the playtest: "Alright spooky lady, are you friend or foe because you're sending mixed signals here" </p>

<p>The playtesting also gave us a lot of pointers on how to better tutorialize the game, which we have also been working on since! </p>

<p>That’s it for now, we’ll be back next week with more updates. Thanks again to everyone who has played the demo! It is really inspiring (and only occasionally maddening) to see people play what the team has been working on. See ya!</p>
