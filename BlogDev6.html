              <h3> Welcome 2026! </h3>
              <p>Welcome to our 6th and latest Devlog. January is going too fast for us to keep track of, but we are trucking along towards our February Demo deadline fast. For that, a bunch of work has gotten done over the past two weeks.</p>

              <p>New music is getting added and it is “PEAK” (developer quote). This music will be for our new character Annie and a retrospective song for the relationship between our… troubled scientists Lily and Malva.</p>

<p>Related to our characters! If you haven’t yet, take a gander at our social media posts, where some character teasers have been added over the past week (and more will continue to be added! Keep an eye out)
    Also, as a little bonus, see below for a new animation teasing an intense scene in the new demo. What could Jada be kicking at?</p>
              <img class="MainBlogImageLeft" src="images/JadaKick.gif">

              <p>A majority of dev-work has gone towards playtesting and bug-fixing our demo build,which is looking better and better as the kinks get ironed out. You’d think that the game developer could not get scared of their own horror game but when a jump-scare happens when it’s not supposed to then it still hits.</p>

              <p>To launch the demo properly, we are also working on a new shiny trailer for our Steam page which should be ready close to the time the demo is.</p>

              <p>That’s all for this week! Hope you have a good rest of your January, and see you in the next month! The month of… DEMOS.</p>
